<content:encoded><![CDATA[

The question on investors’ lips following Microsoft’s (MSFT) earnings call last week is: are substantial capital investments in AI infrastructure justified when growth and margins don’t reflect improvements? Although I’m a long-term bull and reiterate my optimistic stance following the tech giant’s results, the stock has been in limbo over the past six months. Some impatient investors have abandoned ship, struggling to acquiesce to the narrative that Microsoft’s market performance and investment

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Alphabet will face investor scrutiny over its massive spending on AI when it reports earnings on Tuesday, as revenue growth at the Google parent likely slowed in the holiday quarter due to a slowdown in its advertising and cloud businesses.  Like other U.S. technology heavyweights, Alphabet faces new scrutiny on its capital expenditure after Chinese startup DeepSeek last month launched low-cost AI models that threaten to push the AI industry into a price war.  Alphabet's capital expenditure is estimated to have been $50 billion for last year, according to LSEG, with more planned for 2025 to support its cloud expansion and AI-driven search features, including summaries, which are vital to defending its market share and attracting more ad revenue.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The race for AI chip dominance is one of the hottest battlegrounds in tech today, and tech legend Bill Gates has thoughts about it. On a recent episode of Opening Bid with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, Gates praised Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang for turning the company into one of the world’s most valuable. Gates specifically singles out Nvidia's innovations "at the design level — the silicon, the buses, [and] the interconnects." But Gates also acknowledged the intense pressure Huang faces in a competitive industry, noting, “I wouldn’t want to be Jensen, necessarily.” While Nvidia is leading the charge, other tech giants, including Microsoft (MSFT), are developing their own AI chips, making it harder to predict what comes next. Nonetheless, Gates marveled at Huang’s ability to stay ahead, calling Nvidia’s success “unbelievable” in the AI age. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website. This post was written by Rachael Lewis-Krisky, producer for Opening Bid.

DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company that develops large language models (LLMs), turned the world of AI on its head recently when it claimed that it spent just $5.6 million (note this is million, not billion) on computing power to develop its base AI model.  Historically, about half of the spending on data centers goes toward servers.  The claim that DeepSeek could build an LLM so cheaply sent shock waves through the markets last week, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the biggest loser.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Although Microsoft founder Bill Gates sat down for an interview with The Associated Press to discuss his new memoir, “Source Code: My Beginnings,” he also shared his views on a variety of other topics, including vaccine conspiracy views about him, his thoughts on the struggles of longtime computer chipmaker Intel and his take on the antitrust challenges facing Google.  Having poured billions of dollars into diseases such as polio and malaria through his foundation, Gates was dumbfounded about the conspiracy theories that erupted during the pandemic about the COVID vaccine being tied to his efforts to kill people or other sinister agendas.  Although he remains puzzled by it all, Gates isn't too worried yet, even if outspoken vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is confirmed as the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in President Donald Trump's administration.
