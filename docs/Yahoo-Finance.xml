Headline Venture Partner Kamran Ansari joins Asking for a Trend discuss investment opportunities beyond Big Tech in the artificial intelligence sector. Ansari notes that among Big Tech names, "it's an arms race" to get ahead in artificial intelligence, emphasizing that "they're investing for the future." He distinguishes between companies like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT), whose stocks are down as they invest in AI to resell through client services, versus Meta Platforms (META), whose stock is up as they invest further in AI for internal use. However, he highlights smaller social media platforms Pinterest (PINS), Reddit (RDDT), and Snap Inc. (SNAP). "Those are smaller companies that are not in this arms race," he explains, adding that for them, "the name of the game is eyeballs" as they focus on monetizing their existing user bases. Watch the full video above to hear Ansari's outlook on DeepSeek's impact on the AI market.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The emergence of Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek — which claims to offer more affordable and efficient AI capabilities — has stirred global tech markets. New York University Stern School of Business professor of economics Nouriel Roubini, also known as "Dr. Doom," joins Catalysts to discuss its implications for US equities (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC). Roubini views technology as a current economic driver, citing quantum computing automation, robotics, and fintech as "the industries of the future." He suggests these innovations could potentially boost growth to 3% by this decade's end. Despite concerns about potential inflationary policies from the Trump administration in the short term, Roubini maintains his recommendation to be overweight in equities, particularly in tech and the "Magnificent Seven" stocks. Regarding DeepSeek specifically, Roubini notes that "if what they have done is true," it will motivate the US to increase productivity growth, describing it as "a positive supply shock" for the global economy. "DeepSeek, in my view, is an evolution, not a revolution," he concludes. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

<title>Is the Magnificent 7 trade in big trouble?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
So much for the untouchable "Magnificent 7 trade." Only one of the big-cap tech components — Meta (META) — has delivered double-digit gains year to date.Amazon is the only other Mag 7 component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.9%, slightly ahead of the 3.4% increase for the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC). The other Mag 7 components Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations.So what gives? Fears that the group as a whole is spending way too much to build out AI infrastructure, for starters.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stocks like Nvidia plunged double digits on the news as the new competitor threatened to upend the AI ecosystem.  As of Feb. 7, Nvidia is still 10% lower than where it closed on Jan. 24, representing more than $300 billion in value lost.  There's still a lot of uncertainty as to how DeepSeek will impact the AI sector over the long term, but it seems unlikely to derail the massive ramp-up in spending on AI infrastructure after big tech companies like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon all announced plans to significantly increase their capital expenditures to build cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities.

Every technology company talks profusely about it on its earnings calls, and if any one of them is behind its competitors, none admits it.

<guid>https://finance.yahoo.com/video/mag-7-gains-lag-investors-155722191.html?.tsrc=rss</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The "Magnificent Seven" group (MAGS), made up of Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL), has lagged so far in 2025. NewEdge Wealth chief investment officer Cameron Dawson tells Morning Brief co-hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith this lag is due in part to investors' waning patience with Big Tech's massive spending on artificial intelligence (AI) without seeing a payoff from the investments. Dawson says the new DeepSeek model has sparked questions about Big Tech's spending. There's "a question about the efficacy of CapEx growth within the US tech complex. One of the things is that we've seen huge CapEx spending by the Mag Seven, which, of course, has benefited other Mag Seven names. Are we starting to get to the point where investors are losing patience with this degree of CapEx spending?" The Mag Seven "has lagged as we've gone into 2025, and we think it's because investors are starting to ask the question: What is the return on invested capital for all of this spending that they're doing? We're seeing a lot more competition within AI, which is very much in contrast with these near-monopoly businesses that [are] the core bread and butter of the Mag Seven." To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here. This post was written by Naomi Buchanan.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
As earnings season continues for most of the Big Tech landscape, Wall Street investors have become increasingly focused on tech giant's and hyperscaler's capital expenditure (CapEx) spending on AI. To talk more about how AI CapEx guidance is weighing on Big Tech and semiconductor manufacturers like Nvidia (NVDA), Spear Invest Founder and CIO Ivana Delevska sits down with Seana Smith on Catalysts. Delevska finds the release of DeepSeek's large-language model to have been a positive for Nvidia: "The market completely misinterpreted this to begin with. I think it may be negative for some of the other companies in the value chain, like open source models, but for companies that are making hardware, more innovation is always, by definition, better." Delevska goes on to comment on how cheaper AI chip models could benefit Cloudflare (NET), Arista's (ANET) position in AI networking, and reacts to reports of OpenAI's plans to develop their first custom chip design. The last of the Magnificent Seven to report its latest quarterly performance, Nvidia is scheduled to release earnings results on Wednesday, February 26.

Microsoft has offered to widen the price differential between its Office product sold with its chat and video app Teams and its software sold without the app in a bid to avert a possible EU antitrust fine, according to three sources.  The move by the U.S. tech giant comes five years after Salesforce-owned Slack complained to the European Commission about Microsoft's tying of Teams with Office.  Teams, which was added to Office 365 in 2017 for free and eventually replaced Skype for Business, became popular during the pandemic due in part to its video conferencing.

<guid>https://finance.yahoo.com/video/bill-gates-quantum-computings-future-120050326.html?.tsrc=rss</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Arguments around the pacing for quantum computing are at the forefront of tech news these days, and now Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates has weighed in. On a recent episode of Opening Bid with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, Gates considered Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang’s prediction that the technology might take 15 to 30 years to become truly impactful. While Gates agreed that building a quantum computer and developing the right software is a complex undertaking, he also suggested that breakthroughs such as AI could happen in just three to five years. "And Microsoft is a competitor in that space. And I regularly review that work and I'm quite impressed with it," Gates explained, hinting that the race for quantum supremacy could be heating up sooner than expected. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website. This post was written by Rachael Lewis-Krisky, producer for Opening Bid.

<guid>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/judge-says-elon-musks-claims-201644258.html?.tsrc=rss</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Elon Musk's lawyers faced off with OpenAI in court Tuesday as a federal judge weighed the billionaire's request for a court order that would block the ChatGPT maker from converting itself to a for-profit company.  U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said it was a “stretch” for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn't intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its transition from a nonprofit research laboratory to a for-profit corporation.  Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek sent shares of major technology companies into a tailspin after it revealed a highly cost-effective AI model that was trained using limited resources but is competent enough to match the performance of more powerful and expensive models from the likes of OpenAI.  Of course, there are concerns about the veracity of the claims that DeepSeek is making about the costs incurred to train its AI model as well as the type of chips it has access to.  OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms are just some of the names that have been accumulating powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), costing tens of thousands of dollars from Nvidia to deploy data centers capable of AI model training and inferencing.

Alphabet will face investor scrutiny over its massive spending on AI when it reports earnings on Tuesday, as revenue growth at the Google parent likely slowed in the holiday quarter due to a slowdown in its advertising and cloud businesses.  Like other U.S. technology heavyweights, Alphabet faces new scrutiny on its capital expenditure after Chinese startup DeepSeek last month launched low-cost AI models that threaten to push the AI industry into a price war.  Alphabet's capital expenditure is estimated to have been $50 billion for last year, according to LSEG, with more planned for 2025 to support its cloud expansion and AI-driven search features, including summaries, which are vital to defending its market share and attracting more ad revenue.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The race for AI chip dominance is one of the hottest battlegrounds in tech today, and tech legend Bill Gates has thoughts about it. On a recent episode of Opening Bid with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, Gates praised Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang for turning the company into one of the world’s most valuable. Gates specifically singles out Nvidia's innovations "at the design level — the silicon, the buses, [and] the interconnects." But Gates also acknowledged the intense pressure Huang faces in a competitive industry, noting, “I wouldn’t want to be Jensen, necessarily.” While Nvidia is leading the charge, other tech giants, including Microsoft (MSFT), are developing their own AI chips, making it harder to predict what comes next. Nonetheless, Gates marveled at Huang’s ability to stay ahead, calling Nvidia’s success “unbelievable” in the AI age. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website. This post was written by Rachael Lewis-Krisky, producer for Opening Bid.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company that develops large language models (LLMs), turned the world of AI on its head recently when it claimed that it spent just $5.6 million (note this is million, not billion) on computing power to develop its base AI model.  Historically, about half of the spending on data centers goes toward servers.  The claim that DeepSeek could build an LLM so cheaply sent shock waves through the markets last week, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the biggest loser.
